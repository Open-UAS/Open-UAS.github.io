## Maintenance for the 3D printer

Summary table For quick refernce 
| Part | How often it should be cleaned | How to clean it| 
| :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| Rods | Before every print | Wipe with a clean paper towel. DO NOT USE A CLEANER OF ANY KIND!!!!!| 
| Printing bed | Before every print | Wipe with a wet paper towel. Only use soap and water on a towel if glue was previously used on the bed and remains on the surface. |
| Flash Drive | Every Semester (approx 16-20 weeks) | Plus into the USB port on the laptop from here there are two methods. Manually remove the files from the files tab or Right click the device in the files tab and select format, then quick format to remove everything on the flashdrive. \* For mac please look up instructions|
| Environment | Monthly | Move the printer to a different location and wipe down the counter and dust surrounding the area. Replace printer to location. \*Remember to unplug the printer when moving it |


## General use 

Before using the printer, a few things should be cleaned and checked before beginning the print. The biggest and most important part of regular maintenance for the printer is making sure the rods are dust free. A big note for the printer rods is that they are used by the self-lubricating bearing that connects the printer head and bed to the rest of the printer. This is important because if you add a cleaner that is unsafe for the bearing, you will cut the printer's lifespan significantly. 

With this in mind, the first maintenance step before each print is to take a clean paper towel and wipe the rods as is. DO NOT add cleaner (Including soap with water) or use a disinfectant wipe; this will cause damage to the bearings and, therefore, the printer. In many cases, black/ gray dirt may come off the rods. That's okay; that is why we are wiping them down; if we do not remove the dirt, it will build up and create a squeaking noise (otherwise described as cat screeching). If it does get to this point, it will take a few times to wipe off the rods before the noise stops.

For the printing bed, the prep is a little different. Depending on what material you are printing with, it will depend on how you prep it, but the most common way is to wipe the bed down with a wet paper towel to remove any dirt on the bed. If the last print you did needs to be glued onto the bed, it is recommended to wipe the bed down with a soapy paper towel until the glue is completely removed, then dry the bed afterward. Depending on the material you are printing with, it might change, but currently, for the materials in the lab, you then wipe the bed down with a 93% alcohol solution that can be applied with a paper towel (not the one you cleaned it with).
