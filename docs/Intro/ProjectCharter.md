## Background
No open source UAS options exist that are fixed-wing and accessible (conceptually) to the general public. Some similar, available UASâ€™ are the Albatross (created and sold commercially by Applied Aeronautics) and Razor (created a UVA). Open source software options already available include ArduPilot and PX4.

## Project Scope
We are producing an open-source, COTS UAS that can be used for education and research purposes; the UAS shall only consist of components available to the general public. 

## Project Objectives
* Create an open-source, COTS UAS for educational and research flights
* Provide full documentation of the conception, design, and testing of all systems
* Act as a test bed for Dr. Rozier's system health management experiments
* Be easily launched and not require a runway for takeoff or landing
* Be piloted by students and hobbyists
* Be reconfigurable and support additional components

## Project Deliverables
* A functioning design and prototype of a UAS
* Relevant tools for piloting the UAS from the ground
* Extensive documentation of the design process
* Extensive documentation of the manufacturing process
* Extensive documentation on proper use and safety

## Project Constraints
* COTS components
* Affordable components
* Easily duplicated components (e.g. all 3D printed parts can be reasonably produced by hobbyists)
* All components should be reasonably safe (e.g. battery)
* Documentation and design must allow for construction by non-specialists

## Project Assumptions
* The UAS shall be fixed-wing
* The UAS can be constructed in a maker space
* There is a customizable autopilot available
* There is existing hardware, material, and design technology available
* The UAS can be built by someone with a minimum of a high school education
