## Navigating Documentation Sources

Once you are added to the Google Drive folder and the Github repository,
you have access to all of the team's documentation over the past 3+
years. This can be daunting at first, so please read the following
sections if you are confused about where to start.

### Github


The OpenUAS team keeps much of our formal documentation in Github.
Github is a tool that hosts git, a file versioning system. For more
information on this, this website does a good job explaining Github and
git:
<https://blog.devmountain.com/git-vs-github-whats-the-difference/>.\
After you have made a Github account and are added to the team's
repository, start to take a look at our documentation. One good place to
start is with the final reports created each semester by the team. These
reports provide a variety of information including an overview of the
project and teams, the status of the project, and the progress made by
each sub-team for that semester. It also contains valuable lessons
learned which may help you as you begin work on the project. The path to
these reports is:
[OpenUAS/Documentation/Final\_Reports](OpenUAS/Documentation/Final_Reports).\
Another good place to explore in the Github repository are the progress
reports made by each team member (under the ProgressReports directory).
These reports are great insight on what a member of the OpenUAS team
works on on a week-to-week basis. You will also have to create your own
progress reports as soon as you start receiving credit for the research,
so these are helpful to look at to know what is expected. For
information on creating these items, see Section 4 below.

### Google Drive


The OpenUAS Google Drive folder contains more of the team's informal
documentation and work. In this folder, you can find everything from
performance calculations spreadsheets to possible design configurations.
There isn't one area that you should look at right away, but as you have
time, explore the directories within this drive folder. You will learn a
lot about what the team has worked on.

## Personal Documentation


Every student on the team is required by Dr. Rozier to create personal
documentation during their time on the team. This includes weekly
reports as well as a semester plan. Each is described in detail below.
There are templates for these reports found in the Github repository
under the ProgressReports directory. Create your own directory (folder)
within the ProgressReports directory with your initials as the name.
Then, copy both the weekly reports template and the semester plan
template into your folder and fill in the necessary information. These
documents are created in markdown, a fairly simple markup language. If
you are having issues understanding this format, this resource might be
useful for you: <https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax>.
It is critical that you complete this documentation by the end of the
semester as this is what Dr. Rozier uses to give you a grade for the
research credit.

### Weekly Reports


Weekly reports are exactly what they sound like: a written update on
what you did during the week. This includes your objectives and
deliverables from the previous week and if you completed them. You are
also required to describe any road blocks you faced during the week and
describe in more detail your overall accomplishments for the week.
Finally, you create objectvies and deliverables for the next week.

### Semester Plan


At the beginning of each semester, you are required to create a semester
plan. This semester plan contains your goals, deliverables, and plan to
mitigate risks during the semester. There is also a table-calendar to
fill out. It is often necessary to update your semester plan multiple
times during the semester as new deliverables or tasks arise.

## Advice


1.  Ask questions constantly - no question is dumb. Everyone on the team
    is willing to help you!

2.  Look into the Git and LaTeX resources early. It is up to you to make
    sure you understand these tools.

3.  Keep up-to-date on your weekly reports. It can be easy to get behind
    on this documentation, but it is a pain to make up as it is often
    difficult to remember what you worked on weeks ago.

4.  Find what you are passion about on the team. If you joined the team
    in one area but find out your interests are elsewhere on the
    project, talk to your Team or Project Leader about eventually
    switching areas.

5.  Ask Dr. Rozier for career advice. She is very knowledgeable and is
    always willing to help.
