Some initial design considerations:

*Using Lulz Bot 3D printer - which is completely open source friendly*

We need to make some design decisions about what software will be used...

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Software--

3D Design:

open source options:
Blender, FreeCAD, OpenSCAD (programmatic CAD), TinkerCAD, 123D Design, Onshape

Blender - Typically used for creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3D printed models and video games.
Can be difficult to learn.  Handy to have for fixing and making simple changes to STL files.

123D Design - Like autodesk inventor -- includes tools for scanning, sculpting, electronics, 2D deign and 
more.  Powerful & easy to use

TinkerCAD - Runs in web browser, uses Boolean modeling to make objects using shapes and building blocks.
Combine basic shapes to create more complex designs

OpenSCAD and ImplicitCAD - Programmatic CAD, uses programming language to create objects

FreeCAD - Parametric modeling allows design to be easily modified, good program for converting STEP files
to STL

Onshape - Cloud-based product -- created by solidworks team and would be very similar

commercial options:
rhino, solidworks, autodesk

Rhino - Reliable for converting file types

Solidworks and AutoDesk - Professional grade CAD software

CFD Software Considerations:


Open source:
OpenFOAM - Has a large user base across most areas of engineering and science, from both commericial
and academic organizations.  Has an extensive range of features to solve anything from complex fluid flows 
involving chemical reactions, turbulence and heat transfer.

Commerical:
ANSYS - Licenses at UC - professional grade CFD

We will pursue open source options for this project.  We would like for our design to be readily available 
to universities everywhere, so open source avoids universities needing access to commercial software. OpenFOAM
was the only widely used open source CFD software package found while researching.  This will be used for 
CFD analysis.  Blender seems to be the most widely used open source 3D design software, however, after further
research, I found that Blender is typically used for animation.  I am thinking that FreeCAD or OpenSCAD will
possibly be the best options for our application.   I will be doing further research into what people have used
with the particular 3D printer which we will be using (LULZ Bot).

WING CONSIDERATIONS:

Foam wing:

Advantages - lightweight, somewhat easy to construct

Disadvantages - fragile, must find method to run spars down middle of wing, less room to
spread payload throughout wing

3D printable rib wing w/ fabric cover:

Advantages: lightweight, room to spread payload throughout wing

Disadvantages/Considerations: Finding reliable & lightweight fabric

Different Material Options (3D printing)

PLA
-good, brittle material
-will work differently depending on manufacturer 

Polycarbonate
-very strong layer bonding

Nylon
-strong and flexible

^Link to a tutorial in FreeCAD, stepping through turning a 2D sketch into a 3D printable object

https://all3dp.com/freecad-tutorial-3d-printing/

^Another step-by-step tutorial


After reading through information on Blender and FreeCAD, I think that FreeCAD better suits what we are 
looking for.  Blender is the most widely used open source 3D design software, but it is widely used for
video animation and game creation.  It is widely used for creating objects like animated animals and humans. 
FreeCAD is more suited for engineering applications, and the Lulz bot manual also stated that its STL files 
were best compatible with the 3D printer.  There are plenty of tutorials available for how to use the software.
I was able to find two right away (links above) after one simple google search.

FreeCAD Notes from tutorials/free cad website

-You can create a fully parametric model programmed in Python.  I'm not sure how involved 
something like this would be -- but I think it would be cool if we could create a model
where the size of the payload will actually scale our model to size.  Then it would also 
scale the size of the wings // as well as providing an input for 2d airfoil shapes so we 
can use any airfoil we would like. 

We have a few known relationships:

Wto=Wp/.201 *ballpark figure developed from previous historical data* Wp=payload weight
		Wto=take-off weight

S=Wto/dws *where S is the wing area, Wto is the take off weight, and dws is the design point
		for wing loading chosen by the user*

b=sqrt(S*dAR)  *where b is the wingspan, S is the area of the wing, and dAR is the aspect ratio



--I have already created a matlab script which uses the relationships discussed above and many 
more to make some initial 2d flight performance estimations.  I could easily translate this script
into python and maybe take it a step further to create a scalable UAS design.  Perhaps starting 
with our core Ironbird components as the base model.  Then, for example, if we would like to
add extra payload, we can create relationships which will manipulate the size & length of the 
fuselage, as well as the wings and tail.  -- The scalable models could just be a baseline to start
with and then of course anyone could personally customize the script if necessary


Some things I need to know:
-Dimensions of each component of the Ironbird (in component list I believe, if not, probably 
available on the internet
-I have a very good grasp on how to size the wings given the payload.  Would like to look into
how to go about sizing the fuselage [aircraft performance book is probably a good starting point]
-Start looking into PLA mass properties in order to approximate, given a certain size fuselage,
if it will go over weight allowance for payload size
-Once approximate weight of fuselage is calculated, how much weight is left to contribute to
the wings and tail.  

SOME PROPERTIES OF PLA:

 Density: 1.210–1.430 g·cm−3

 Melting point: 150-160 degrees celcius/ 302-320 degrees F

Python/FreeCAD notes:

-Current FreeCAD has very few native commands to interact with 3D objects
-FreeCAD has a built-in python interpreter which allows you to be a power user and 
easily customize your designs
-From the interpreter , you can access all system-installed Python modules, as well as built-in
FreeCAD modules

^^ More python scripting documentation

-App module is for creating object properties, Gui module is for creating the visual object
-each object will have an app & gui file

#creates a new file
doc=FreeCAD.newDocument()

#creates box
box = doc.addObject("Part::Box","myBox")
doc.recompute()

#to explore the contents of the box type:
box.

#you can make changes such as
box.Height=5



#To import the Part module
import Part
