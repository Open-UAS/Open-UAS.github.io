[Powering the Pixhawk](http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-powering-the-pixhawk.html)

This image has the basic wiring set up for the pixhawk. There are a couple differences between this version and what the Open UAS uses.
* UAS does not include the optional PM/Atto
* Servos are attached to the spot showing "Other 5V Powered" through a BEC. BEC is connected to AUX Out on the Pixhawk as well as the ground and power directly from the PDB.
