Better get working on this soon

Acronym

  LVC - Low Voltage Cutoff - A component/circuit that cuts power to a component to stop it from overdrawing a battery that is low on power.
  
  BEC - Battery Eliminator Circuit - Takes out the need for another battery when powering multiple circuits, delivers electrical power to other circuits. Some work as linear voltage regulators (5 volts for example) for parts that require lower voltages (like servos for example). Typically paired with motors to allow control and the motor to be powered by the same battery instead of needing two batteries. Additionally, BECs can include a LVC circuit to help stop a motor from overdrawing a battery during flight. This allows a pilot to fly "dead-stick," or with the control surfaces only, instead of losing total power. A BEC with a LVC is usually a part of an ESC.
  
  ESC - Electronics Speed Controller - Used to regulate the input given from the controller to the motor. It also has several cutoff safety features, including a low battery cutoff, so that the control surfaces of the plane can still be used for an emergency landing. 
  
All things battery: We use multiple Lithium Polymer batteries for the Open UAS (Unmanned Aerial System) to power the system. The standard for our smaller craft is a 3 cell battery. The bigger batteries are a 6 cell battery. Each cell contributes to an optimal 3.7 volts and a max of 4.2 volts. The batteries have various amps associated with them (see battery documents).

  Servos - They controls the Elevators, Rudders, and Alierons. Consist of a servo horn, a connection, and the control surface. Require mounts or something to keep them set in place (not velco).
  
  Motors - We currently have three, with the smallest being no bigger than your thumb, and the largest nearly the size of a fist. The largest is attached to the Albatross, while the smaller two will be desired for the smaller Open UAS models.

  R2U2 - The eventual health management system that will be added to the Open UAS (Professor Rozier's research). A little larger than a credit card, this unit is known for producing a large amount of heat. 

Electronics Tools
  Multimeter
  Wire Cutter - Cut wires, also can be used to strip a wire. Do not cut live wires.
  
  Wire Stripper - Strip the outer insulation (jacket) off the wire, incredibly convenient, adjustable, fast. 
  
  Battery Charger - Blue, charges one battery at a time. Contains several preset options for batteries in the lab. Requires multiple connectors due to different battery brands. See manual next to the charger for in-depth instructions, or the battery documents for shortcuts on battery charging and discharging. 
  
Soldering

Splicing

Twist Cap - Used to combine all of the power and ground (separately) wires into one bundle and use a single output wire to connect the main circuit. To properly use, combine all of the wires and twist in, as the thread in the cap will help hold the wires in place. May require a few attempts to get the wire twisted correctly and secured within the cap. 

Plug and Play - Goal of the electronics system for the Open UAS. The easier it is to configure (and re-configure when changing/updating parts), the better it will be for future teams and individuals who use it (open source).
