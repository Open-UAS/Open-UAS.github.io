\begin{enumerate}

\item The propulsion system shall provide a maximum acceleration of (Max Acceleration).\\

\item The propulsion system shall provide a minimum acceleration of (Min Acceleration).\\

\item The propulsion system shall use an electric motor only.\\

\item The propulsion system shall not excede a maximum velocity of 100 mph in accordance with FAA Regulation Part 107 III.E.3.b.i.\\

\item The propulsion system shall provide a minimum velocity of (Min Velocity).\\

\item The propulsion system shall include the needed cooling devices to stay below critical heat levels.\\

\item The flight motor and propeller combination shall not reduce the flight time below one hour due to power consumption.\\

\item The propeller shall be tested for balance using the Du-Bro 499 Tru-Spin Prop Balancer, and if found not balanced, the propeller shall be corrected.\\

\item The propulsion system shall provide at least 0.2 kilograms of thrust.\\
