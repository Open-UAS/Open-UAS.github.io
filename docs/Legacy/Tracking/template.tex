\section*{Introduction}
The purpose of this document is to help record changes made to the OpenUAS so that the design can be traced back and optimized as needed. \\ \\
In order to add a new iteration to this document, just copy the section titled 'Template' to the end of the document. There will be a number of places that you will need to enter information by replacing the commented explanations in each sub-section. Make sure to iterate the UAS number for each new test / version. If you are making significant redesigns to the UAS, iterate the first number (ie. UAS 1.0, UAS 2.0...) if you are making smaller changes or running tests on a version of the UAS, iterate the second number (ie. UAS 1.1, UAS 1.2...).\\ \\
If you have any questions or suggestions about this document please contact Alex VandeLoo (aavande@iastate.edu)

\subsection*{Changes Overview}
Talk about what changes were done for this version

\subsection*{Reasoning for Decisions}
Why did we choose to do this test. Why did we use certain materials over others.

\subsection*{Tradeoffs}
Go over how the changes affected the performance of the UAS

\subsection*{Structure}
Include a solid model of the UAS. \\ \\
