%This is a file that BibTeX will use to create our bibliography
%
% For a nice list of all of the possible input fields, see:
%    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX#Entry_types
%
% We follow the naming convention that lists the last initial of all authors in order followed by the year of publication. Or, if there is only one author, then the first three letters of that author's last name followed by the year. So, a paper by Abba and Ball published in 2015 would be citation AB15 and a paper by Rozier in 2015 would be Roz15. If there is more than one entry that resolves to the same name, we use lower-case letters to order them. For example, if Abba and Ball, and Alice and Bob each published papers in 2015, the first-published would be AB15a and the other would be AB15b.
