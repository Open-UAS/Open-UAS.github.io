	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\section{Wings}
		
		\item The wings shall be able to withstand drafts of up to 50 knots.\\
		\item The wingspan shall be 5 feet.\\
		\item At a zero AOA wings shall produce equal weight to lift.\\
		\item The wing loading factor shall not exceed 2 pounds per square foot.\\
		\item The wings shall have flaperons as control surfaces.\\
		\item The wings shall be attached to the frame of the UAS by ??\\
		\item The wings shall be either made from foam core with composite shell. \\
		\item The wings shall have at least ??? degrees of dihedral. \\
		
	\end{enumerate}
		
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\section{Fuselage}
		
		\item The fuselage shall house the required electronic equipment.\\
		\item The inside of fuselage shall cushion and protect components.\\
		\item The electronic equipment inside the fuselage shall be secured with Velcro or something similar.\\
		\item The fuselage shall contain custom 3D printed storage containers for components.\\
		\item The inside of fuselage shall be accessible without significant deconstruction or special tools.\\
		\item The fuselage shall be able to withstand minimum impact of 2G.\\
	
	\end{enumerate}

	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\section{Empennage}
			
		\item The empennage shall be a traditional tail style with vertical and horizontal stabilizers.\\

		\item The tail shall have an elevator.\\
		
	\end{enumerate}

	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\section{Materials}
		
		\item The 3D printed components shall be produced by the LulzBot Taz 6 3D printer.\\

	\end{enumerate}		

	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\section{General}
		
		\item All components shall be placed such that the center of gravity is stable.\\
		\item All connection points shall be able to withstand minimum impact of 2G.\\
