\begin{enumerate}

\item The controls system shall utilize both an open and closed feedback loop.\\

\item The controls system shall respond within 1 second to internal commands.\\

\item The controls system shall be capable of performing in environments with external forces (some value) such as mild cross winds.\\

\item The controls system shall use the wings and ailerons as primary control.\\

\item The controls system shall be stable in cruise flight.\\

\item The controls system shall be able to operate in max speed flight.\\

\item The controls system shall included the needed cooling devices to stay below critical heat levels.\\

\item The controls system shall be activated using electronics and airflow only.\\

\item The controls system shall have restricted range of motion to avoid damaging the control surfaces.\\

\item The controls system shall be light enough to be controlled with servos. \\

\item The controls system shall operate without harming other components of the UAS.\\

\item The controls system shall be able to complete a controlled landing if the main motor fails.\\
