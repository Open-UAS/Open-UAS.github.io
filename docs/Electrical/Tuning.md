# PX-4 PID Tuning

This page talks about tuning the controller gains in PX-4. This is essential for pilots seeking certain flight characteristics such as increased responsiveness to controller inputs.

We have been using the same guidelines as [PX-4's Tuning Guide](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/config_fw/pid_tuning_guide_fixedwing.html) and we recommend following the same process. Here we have added some more information and lessons learnt.
