## Introduction
The OpenUAS Design team utilizes SolidWorks to model the UAV designs. The team has created 3 versions: OpenUAS 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0, which can be looked at in more detail on the left side of your screen. The Design team is also implementing computational fluid dynamics (CFD), using StarCCM+, in their considerations with modifying designs prior to and following flight tests. This allows the team to look at pressure data, for example, to modify existing parts before flight.
