# Design

## Introduction
The OpenUAS Design team utilizes SolidWorks to model the UAV designs. Below are some of the models as well as some design characteristics for each model. The Design team is also implementing computational fluid dynamics (CFD), using StarCCM+, in their considerations with modifying designs prior to and following flight tests.
