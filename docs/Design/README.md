last updated 4/18/2022

* Extruded Filament diameter is 0.25 mm = 0.00984252’’ ~ 0.01’’
* The minimum thickness on any CAD component should be no less than 1/16’’ = 0.0625’’
* The preferred thickness for material (around holes, etc.) is 0.1’’ Minimum
* Hole tolerances at least 0.02’’ increase in diameter
* Max Print Size: 11” x 11’’

## OpenUAS part naming 
# Introduction 
The purpose of this section is to set a naming scheme for the use of the team that is both functional and pratical for current and future memeber of the team as well as those that chose to use the design later on. 

# Set up 
The use of a part number is excellenct tool for being able to refernce and communcate between subteams about a particular issues that may arise throughout the development of an UAS. 
In our particluar case we wanted to be to esure that the part number served for a number of purposes to encourge the repeated use of the naming scheme. For our final product in the naming scheme
we conculded that the most useful parts to a part number would include the following

* Material type Denotaded by letter/letters 
* Number following a dash set by the order it apears on the unit 
* Optional quilty number (after a dash) that is only included when one part is identical and there are mulptile used in the design

** Examples 
P-01-03   :  the part is made of PLA is the first major part to appear and there should be 3 copies of the part used in the design. 

This breakdown allows for the part number to also tell anyone looking at the parts a lot about the part. This helps to remove the guessing game that sometime arises 
from the transtion of CAD/Design process to the manufacturing and testing process. 

| Material | Letter | 
| ---| --------|
| PLA | P |
| ABS | A |
| Poster board/Foam board| F |
| Balsa Wood | W | 




#General notes for goals 
Items to Change from OpenUAS 1.0/2.0 
*1.0*
-Better access to electronics
-Better flight characteristics
-Better reparability
-Tailwheel configuration is harder to control
-Better Manufacturability
-Better transportability (multiple piece wing)
B-etter corect for left turning tendencies
*2.0* 
-More room for electronics / better mounting surfaces / better planning for electronics integration
-Higher stability
