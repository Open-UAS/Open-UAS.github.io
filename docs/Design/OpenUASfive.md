# Open UAS 5.0 (work in prog-Karan)
## Summary
The main objective of the OpenUAS 5.0 model is to be affordable and simplistic in materials. The model is designed to serve as a kit with a set of detailed instructions. The 5.0 model is made of a fully 3D printed airframe allowing for more complex geometry with improved aerodynamics The instructions for this model breaks down each step with details, tips, and visuals to aid the reader's process of assembling the model (Still Under Development).

## Goals
- Cost-effective
- Reconfigurable
- Easy to manufacture
- Optimized for research payloads
- 3D printed airframe
